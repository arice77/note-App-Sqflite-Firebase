# Notes App(Offline and Online Database Enabled)

The notes app is a mobile application that allows users to create and manage notes both online and offline. The app uses Firebase for online data storage and synchronization, while SQFlite is used for offline storage.

When a user creates a new note or updates an existing note while online, the changes are immediately synchronized with the Firebase cloud database. If the user is offline, the changes are stored locally using SQFlite and then synchronized with Firebase the next time the device is online.

The app features a clean and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily create and manage notes. Users can create new notes, edit existing notes, and delete notes with ease. The app also provides a search feature to help users quickly find specific notes.

Overall, the notes app is a reliable and efficient tool for users who need to create, manage, and store notes both online and offline.
